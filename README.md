This app is currently in progress and not deployed.

It generates word ladders and asks the user to solve them within a maximum number of steps. The word ladder puzzles are generated by first:
1. Making a random word ladder using the 5000 most common English words. (I found a csv file on github, but unfortunately I'm unable to find it again.)
2. Then finding the shortest path between those two words using only the 5000 most common English words.

User input steps are considered valid if
1. there is one letter of difference between the step and the previous step
2. and the word can be found among the 200K most common English words, found here: https://github.com/cmusphinx/cmudict
